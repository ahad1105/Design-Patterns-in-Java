Composite Design Pattern is generally used in a enviroment where we create a tree structure.Where one object can have multiple object and that object can have multiple object . 
whatever operations you can perform on the leaf node should be performed on the composite objects as well.
Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.
